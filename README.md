### Welcome to my github profile
###### Nando Kools
I'm a graduated student from Leeuwenborgh and Vista College.

I've got a degree in "Application & Media Developer" and "Assistant Network Manager".

Currently, i'm trying to expand my knowledge on certain areas involving IT.

I'm learning a bit about Pentesting and security, as well as lockpicking & physical pentesting.

I'm also learning more about programming every day, and have a feeling I'm barelly scratching the surface.
